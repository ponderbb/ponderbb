### Hi you ðŸ‘‹

welcome my warehouse of backlogged projects! I am a data scientist wanna:honeybee: *(aargh another one of those...)* spending his time on his precious debugger, mostly just complaining that deep learning should be considered applied magic and spending his nights staring at error messages like;

`+++ Divide By Cucumber Error. Please Reinstall Universe And Reboot +++`<br />
`*Blip* *Blip* *Blip* Year Of The Sloth *Blip* *Blip* *Blip*`<br />
`++?????++ Out of Cheese Error. Redo From Start.`<br />

that is clearly making him re-evaluate his life choices :facepalm:

So in my sane moments, I'm...

- ðŸ”­ working with medical image segmentation and exploring MLOps best practices.
- ðŸŒ± researching multi-task learning approaches for mobile robotics.
- ðŸ‘¯ eager to collaborate on data & vision themed hackathons.
- ðŸ¤” glad for pointers on Python libraries making my life easier.
